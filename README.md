# Brightway Recipes
Calculation recipes for [brightway2](https://brightwaylca.org/). Instructions to becoming an LCA gourmet.

## This repository
This repository is meant to be a community platform for learning [brightway2](https://brightwaylca.org/). It collects tutorials and calculation recipes for beginners and advanced users.

## Table of Contents
- [0_first_project](0_first_project.ipynb): setup first brightway project, import ecoinvent
- [1_first_LCA](1_first_LCA.ipynb): conduct multi-method, static LCA of one ecoinvent activity
- [2_database_manipulation](2_database_manipulation.ipynb): manipulate ecoinvent database such that all medium voltage electricity markets are replaced by wind electricity production
- [3_plotting](3_plotting.ipynb): calculate LCIA scores for multiple activities and methods and plot the result using pandas
- [4_sankey](3_sankey.ipynb): do contribution analysis for an activity and draw a sankey diagram
