All technosphere flows (matrix T) have been divided by the respective industry's principal production (p = intermediate consumption + final consumption) and the resulting matrix has been subtracted from the unity matrix (A = I-A_norm = I-T/p). If we wish to recover the original T-matrix, we need to reverse this transformation: T = (I - A_norm) x p. First, let's load the principal production vector."

This means, we can inspect flows and do LCIA calculations as usual. But if we want to manipulate Exiobase data, e.g. change flow amounts or add activities, we need to do so in the original Excel files, re-pack them, and re-import the .tar file. This is because the new backend stores data differently, than the standard SQL backend, to achieve higher performance."
